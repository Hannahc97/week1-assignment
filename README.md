# week1-assignment
This is the walking skeleton for the splash page.

Reflection:

The requirements I achieved included having a header, navbar and footer html tag. 
I also used absolute positioning, to overlay text (h3) on to the three images.
I made use of the flexbox tool on the nav bar and for the three images to ensure that the content was in the centre and block-lined. 
I made sure that the image elements were correctly implemented by having a source and alt attribute. I also ensured that the images were not from the web and from my files. 
Another feature I implemented was a hover effect on buttons to make them more interactive. As well I added social media icons on the footer which link to social media pages

There were some stretch requirments that I couldn't achieve as they were a bit challenging to implement. 

I did find the centering some of the elements a bit tricky as they would not move in the correct direction. I also wanted to link the text in the navbar to the images and text, however I was unable to do that, if you can advise how to do that, that would be much appreciated! Also I would like to know how to create other internal web pages. 

I would like to request some feedback about my submission, espeically on whether I used the flexbox model correctly. Also if I have overcomplicated any of the CSS, which could be simplified. As well, I would like to know how to centre text on top of an image exactly in the centre of it. 

I used W3schools to help me with my work and I looked at the elements tab for the SpaceY website to get an idea of how it was structured. I used google fonts to get a nice font style for my website.

Sometimes the positioning of images and text would not go the way I wanted to, so I would try all of the options that would appear for that property. I used a lot of trial and error. 

I liked how after playing around with some of the properites I started to remember which ones worked for that image/text and which ones didn't. Then I would use them for other images/text
